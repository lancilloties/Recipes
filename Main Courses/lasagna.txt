Lasagna

Ingredients:
    1 pound (454 g) ground beef
    2-3 cloves garlic - minced
    1 cup mushrooms, chopped
    1 medium onion, chopped
    1 tablespoon dried basil
    1 can (796 mL, 26.9 fl oz) diced tomatoes
    2 cans (156 mL, 5.5 fl oz) tomato paste
    10 oz (275 g) lasagna noodles (8-10 noodles)
    3 cups cottage cheese
    1 cup parmesan cheese, grated
    2 tablespoons dried parsley
    2 large eggs, beaten
    1/2 teaspoon black pepper
    1 pound (454 g) mozzarella cheese, grated

Instructions:
1    In a large saucepan, over medium heat, brown the ground beef. Drain off the fat, and then add the garlic, mushrooms, onion and basil to the pan.
2    Cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes until the onions are softened slightly.
3    Add the tomatoes and tomato paste and stir to combine.
4    Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5    In a large pot, boil the lasagna noodles until al dente, about 10 minutes (I use whole wheat noodles, the time may be a bit less for white noodles) and drain.
6    In a large bowl, combine the cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, parsley, pepper, and beaten eggs.
7    In a 9x13 inch baking pan, layer the lasagna. Place half the noodles in the pan and spread with half the cottage cheese mixture. Next spread one third of the mozzarella cheese and then half the meat sauce. Repeat these layers and then top with the remaining third of the mozzarella cheese.
	When layering, ensure to put a bit of meat at the bottom to ensure it doesnt stick and a layer of cheese covering meat at the top to prevent pasta burning.
8    Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes, or until the cheese has started to brown and the filling is hot and bubbling.
9    Let it stand for at least 10 minutes to set up before cutting into squares and serving.
