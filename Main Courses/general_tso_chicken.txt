General Tso's Chicken

Ingredients:
1/2 cup bown sugar
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
3 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut in 1 inch pieces
1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
6 green onions, sliced, plus more for topping
3 tablespoons fresh minced ginger
A pinch of red pepper flake
1 teaspoon sesame oil
Sesame seeds, for topping
Prepared rice, for serving

Instructions:
1 - In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, hoisin sauce, rice wine vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce and water. Set aside.
2 - Place the cornstarch in a large ziplock bag. Add the chicken and seal the bag, then shake until the chicken is coated with the cornstarch.
3 - Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken just until browned. Remove from the skillet to a plate and cover to keep warm.
4 - Add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of oil to the skillet, then add the green onions, ginger and the red pepper flakes. Cook until fragrant, about 1 min.
5 - Add the sauce mixture and bring to a boil. Simmer for 2 min or until the sauce thickens a little.
6 - Add the chicken back into the skillet, toss to coat with the sauce and continue to cook until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the sesame seeds.
7 - Serve over rice, garnished with additional green onions and sesame seeds.

Makes 4 servings.
