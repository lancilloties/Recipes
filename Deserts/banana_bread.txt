Banana Bread

Ingredients:
1 cup very ripe mashed bananas (about 2 bananas)
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup sour creme or plain yogurt or vanilla yogurt
2 beaten eggs
1 1/2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup floured chocolate chips
1 cup chopped wallnuts

Instructions:
1 - In a medium bowl, add all dry ingredients except for the chocolate and sugar then leave mixed there.
2 - In a large bowl, mix all the humid ingredients and the sugar. Mix well.
3 - Gradually add the dry ingredients to the large bowl and mix properly.
4 - Flour the chocolate chips and with the nuts, add to the mix without mixing a lot.
5 - Put the mix in a bread mold of 9x5 covered in butter or floured.
6 - Cook for 1 to 1 1/4 hour at 325 f (160 c).
7 - Pierce with a toothpick or a knife to verify the cooking.

Notes:
The use of plain yogurt instead of sour creme will reduce the fat in the banana bread.
To make it more of a desert, add banana pieces on the top with some brown sugar before it's baked.
